* Integration with GraphRAG toolkit https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit/tree/main for fact extraction using the "lexical-graph" inside of that project.
* Test this with a set of publications.  I can upload those to a directory and we can use that to build a graph and test things.
* Setup notebook access.
* Read and summarize nanopublications. How does this relate to the HyperIBIS model and the proposed schema? Can we align with nanopublications? What are the gaps?
* Extend things in this project to also extract arguments from those documents.
