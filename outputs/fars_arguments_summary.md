# Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR ยง 91.103) - Argument Summary

## Key Claims

1. **Pilots in command are responsible for becoming familiar with all available information concerning their flight before beginning it.**
   - *Evidence*: "Each pilot in command shall, before beginning a flight, become familiar with all available information concerning that flight."

2. **For flights under instrument flight rules (IFR) or not in the vicinity of an airport, pilots must review weather reports, forecasts, fuel requirements, alternatives if the planned flight cannot be completed, and any known traffic delays.**
   - *Evidence*: "For a flight under IFR or a flight not in the vicinity of an airport, weather reports and forecasts, fuel requirements, alternatives available if the planned flight cannot be completed, and any known traffic delays of which the pilot in command has been advised by ATC;"

3. **For any flight, pilots must review runway lengths at intended airports of use and relevant takeoff and landing distance information.**
   - *Evidence*: "For any flight, runway lengths at airports of intended use, and the following takeoff and landing distance information:"

4. **For aircraft with approved manuals containing takeoff and landing distance data, pilots must use that data in their preflight review.**
   - *Evidence*: "For civil aircraft for which an approved Airplane or Rotorcraft Flight Manual containing takeoff and landing distance data is required, the takeoff and landing distance data contained therein;"

5. **For aircraft without approved manuals with takeoff and landing data, pilots must use other reliable performance information appropriate for expected conditions.**
   - *Evidence*: "For civil aircraft other than those specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, other reliable information appropriate to the aircraft, relating to aircraft performance under expected values of airport elevation and runway slope, aircraft gross weight, and wind and temperature."

## Supporting Arguments

### For Claim 1: Pilot responsibility for information
- Weather conditions are critical for safe flight operations
- Sufficient fuel and alternative plans are essential for safety
- Runway lengths and aircraft performance data are crucial for determining safe operations

### For Claim 2: IFR flight requirements
- The regulation explicitly requires pilots to review weather reports, forecasts, fuel requirements, alternatives, and known traffic delays
- The regulation mandates that pilots must become familiar with all available information

### For Claim 3: Runway and takeoff/landing information
- The regulation explicitly states this requirement for any flight
- For aircraft with approved Flight Manuals, pilots must use the data contained therein
- For aircraft without approved Flight Manuals, pilots must use other reliable performance information

### For Claim 4: Use of approved manual data
- The regulation explicitly states this requirement
- This falls under the broader requirement to become familiar with all available information

### For Claim 5: Use of other reliable information
- The regulation explicitly states this requirement for aircraft without approved manuals
- This requirement applies to all flights with such aircraft

## Rebutting Arguments

### Against Claim 1: Pilot responsibility for information
- The regulation specifies information concerning their "specific flight," not necessarily "all available information"
- The regulation lists specific types of information, suggesting not all information is required

### Against Claim 3: Runway and takeoff/landing information
- The regulation specifies this information for airports of "intended use," which could be interpreted as not requiring this for all flights
- The regulation allows for alternative reliable information for certain aircraft

## Gaps in Arguments

1. **Definition of "all available information"**
   - What constitutes "all available information"?
   - Are there limits to what information pilots are expected to obtain?

2. **Standards for "other reliable information"**
   - What qualifies as "reliable information" for aircraft without approved manuals?
   - Who determines reliability of alternative information sources?

3. **Enforcement and compliance**
   - How is compliance with these requirements verified?
   - What are the consequences of non-compliance?

4. **Practical implementation**
   - How do pilots typically fulfill these requirements in practice?
   - What tools or resources are commonly used?

5. **Exceptions or special circumstances**
   - Are there any emergency exceptions to these requirements?
   - How do these requirements apply to unusual flight operations?
