# HyperIBIS Documentation

This directory contains documentation and diagrams for the HyperIBIS (Issue-Based Information System) model, which extends the traditional IBIS model to support inference about belief and expected utility in formal argument models using an open hypertext architecture.

## Overview of HyperIBIS

The HyperIBIS architecture extends the standard IBIS model by:

1. Incorporating an open hypertext model that allows any addressable web resource to be interpreted as evidence in an argument
2. Developing the notion of beliefs, assumptions, value judgments, and expected utility as an elaboration of the basic IBIS graph

The model is designed to support collaborative decision-making, critical thinking, and conflict resolution processes through a structured approach to representing arguments, issues, and evidence.

## Key Components

- **Issues**: Represent questions or problems to be resolved
- **Positions**: Represent possible answers to issues
- **Arguments**: Link evidence to positions
- **Assessments**: Provide personalized interpretations of evidence
- **Evidentiary Network**: A directed graph that propagates evidence through the model

## Special Issue Types

1. **Mutex Issue**: Positions are mutually exclusive
2. **Hypothesis**: Special case with only two possible truth states
3. **World Issue**: Each position represents a different possible world

## Implementation

The HyperIBIS architecture has been implemented as part of the CognitiveWeb effort, which is a semantic web initiative focused on collaborative, process-oriented decision-making.
