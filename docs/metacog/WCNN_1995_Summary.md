## About Metacognition

While I couldn't access the specific paper, I can provide some general context about metacognition:

Metacognition refers to "thinking about thinking" or the awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. It involves:

- **Metacognitive knowledge**: Understanding of one's own cognitive processes and how they work
- **Metacognitive regulation**: The ability to control one's cognitive processes
- **Metacognitive experiences**: Experiences related to current cognitive activity

Metacognition plays important roles in:
- Learning and education
- Problem-solving
- Decision-making
- Memory function
- Self-regulation

When the actual paper becomes available, this summary will be updated with specific details about the WCNN 1995 research and its contributions to the field of metacognition.
