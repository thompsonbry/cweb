## About Metacognition

Metacognition refers to "thinking about thinking" or the awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. The term was coined by American developmental psychologist John H. Flavell in the 1970s.

### Key Components of Metacognition

1. **Metacognitive Knowledge**
   - Knowledge about one's own cognitive processes
   - Understanding of strategies that might be employed for different tasks
   - Knowledge about when and why to use particular strategies

2. **Metacognitive Regulation**
   - Planning: Setting goals and allocating resources
   - Monitoring: Awareness of comprehension and task performance
   - Evaluating: Appraising the final product of a task and the efficiency of learning

3. **Metacognitive Experiences**
   - Conscious experiences that are cognitive or affective
   - Related to an intellectual enterprise
   - Occur during cognitive processing

## The Recognition/Metacognition (R/M) Model

The R/M model described in the WCNN 1995 paper presents a framework for understanding how experienced decision-makers:

1. Recognize situations based on patterns
2. Elaborate on and test those recognitions
3. Determine when to cease elaboration in order to act

The model consists of:
- A situation recognition system
- A gating function (Quick Test)
- Metacognitive processes for critiquing and correcting

This model has been applied to understanding decision-making in complex, high-stakes environments such as military tactical operations.

## Hybrid Architecture for Metacognitive Agents

The WCNN 1995 paper proposes a hybrid architecture combining:

1. **Adaptive Critics**: For reinforcement learning of behavior
2. **SHRUTI Networks**: For reflexive reasoning and structured knowledge representation
3. **Deictic Representations**: For managing attentional focus

This architecture divides cognitive behavior into:
- **Recognitional processes**: Reflexive inference, action policies, and expected utility
- **Metacognitive processes**: Monitoring, critiquing, and correcting

## Applications

The metacognitive approaches described in these documents have applications in:

- Decision support systems
- Intelligent tutoring systems
- Autonomous agents and robotics
- Human-computer interaction
- Cognitive modeling
- Artificial intelligence systems that can reason about their own reasoning
