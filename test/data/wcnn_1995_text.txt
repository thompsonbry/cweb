Title: The Recognition/Metacognition Framework for Tactical Decision Making

Authors: Gary Klein, Roberta Calderwood, and Anne Clinton-Cirocco

Abstract:
This paper presents the Recognition/Metacognition (R/M) framework, a model of tactical decision making that integrates recognition-primed decision making with metacognitive processes. The framework describes how decision makers can use critical thinking to improve their situation awareness and course of action selection in complex, time-pressured situations.

Introduction:
The Recognition/Metacognition (R/M) framework was developed to address limitations in existing models of tactical decision making. It combines the strengths of naturalistic decision making approaches, particularly Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) making, with metacognitive processes that enable critical thinking. The framework is designed to help decision makers handle uncertainty, complexity, and time pressure in tactical environments.

Key Components of the R/M Framework:

1. Recognition-Primed Decision Making:
   - Pattern matching to recognize situations
   - Mental simulation to evaluate courses of action
   - Experience-based intuition for rapid decision making
   - Action scripts for implementing decisions

2. Metacognitive Processes:
   - Quick Test: Rapid assessment of whether critical thinking is needed
   - Story Building: Constructing explanations for observed events
   - Assumption Testing: Identifying and evaluating key assumptions
   - Attention Management: Focusing on relevant information

3. Critical Thinking Strategies:
   - Identifying evidence-conclusion relationships
   - Detecting inconsistencies in situation assessment
   - Evaluating the completeness of information
   - Detecting problems in mental models
   - Correcting errors in reasoning

Applications of the R/M Framework:
The R/M framework has been applied to various domains including military command and control, emergency management, and intelligence analysis. Training programs based on the framework have shown improvements in decision quality, particularly in complex and ambiguous situations.

Empirical Support:
Studies with military officers, firefighters, and other professionals have demonstrated that the R/M framework accurately describes expert decision making processes. Training interventions based on the framework have shown positive results in improving decision quality and reducing decision biases.

Conclusion:
The Recognition/Metacognition framework provides a comprehensive model of tactical decision making that accounts for both intuitive and analytical processes. By integrating recognition-primed decision making with metacognitive processes, the framework offers a practical approach to improving decision making in complex, time-pressured environments.
