## Current Status and Recommendations

The Washington State Department of Health is closely monitoring ongoing federal discussions around potential changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance. At this time, we are not making any changes to our programs or recommendations and will continue to monitor federal guidance as it evolves.

Our priority remains ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. The virus continues to pose serious health risks in Washington, including hospitalizations, long COVID, and preventable deaths, particularly among older adults, people with chronic conditions, and those who remain unvaccinated.

COVID-19 vaccines remain one of our most effective tools for preventing severe illness. We encourage all eligible Washingtonians to stay up to date on their vaccinations to protect themselves, their loved ones, and the broader community.

## Current Recommendations

The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older should get an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine.

As of October 23, 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend adults ages 65 years and older and people moderately or severely immunocompromised receive an additional updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. The recommendation acknowledges the increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19 in older adults, along with the currently available data on vaccine effectiveness.

Most people ages 5-64 years old just need one updated 2024-2025 dose to be up to date.

## Dosing Guidelines

- **People 65 years and older**: Should receive 2 doses of any 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine 6 months apart. If needed, the second dose can be given as soon as 2 months after the first dose.
- **People 6 months and older who are immunocompromised**: Should get at least 2 doses of 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine 6 months apart.
- **Children 6 months-4 years**: May need more than one dose of an updated 2024-2025 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to be up to date.

## Available Vaccines

### mRNA vaccines
- Moderna 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine (ages 6 months and older)
- Pfizer 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine (ages 6 months and older)

### Protein subunit vaccines
- Novavax 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine (ages 12 years and older)

Note: There is no recommendation for any one COVID-19 vaccine over another when more than one recommended and age-appropriate vaccine is available.
